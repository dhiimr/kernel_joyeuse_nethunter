MSM Restart Driver

A power supply hold (ps-hold) bit is set to power the msm chipsets.
Clearing that bit allows us to restart/poweroff. The difference
between poweroff and restart is determined by unique power manager IC
settings.

Required Properties:
-compatible: "qcom,pshold"
-reg: Specifies the physical address of the ps-hold register

<<<<<<< HEAD
Optional Properties:
-qcom,force-warm-reboot: Issue a warm reboot, even for the traditional cases
				where hard reboot is issued.
